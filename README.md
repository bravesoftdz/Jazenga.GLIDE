1: remove all copyright violating code<br>
2: where possible replace copyright notice and reinstate code<br>
3: replace CT tools for which there is no source code<br>
4: remove 3rd party tools for which license cannot be confirmed<br>
5: create new build files as required<br>
6: add new wizards and tools to enhance development<br>
