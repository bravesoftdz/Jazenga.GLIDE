How to install LAMW on Linux.
#############################

The old new_how_to_install_by_renabor has been converted in several scripts that, after downloading all necessary program, make your computer able to crosscompile to arm, win32, win64 and i386-android too!


All you have to do is run first script, "1-master-script.sh", that will call other scripts in the right sequence.

At the end you will have:

1) /etc/fpc.cfg moved to /etc/fpc.cfg.bak and substituded by a symlink
2) ndk, sdk and lamw code placed in a new directory $HOME/Android
3) fpc and lazarus code placed in a new directory $HOME/bin/freepascal
4) a lot of scripts in $HOME/bin/freepascal

and a running compiled full suite of freepascal and lazarus ready to crosscompile to android!

Version of software downloaded:

ndk				android-ndk-r11c-linux-x86_64
sdk				android-sdk_r24.4.1-linux
fpc (fixes)			3.0.1
lazarus 			1.7

enjoy!


PS. 
Scripts have to be run in order and the first to run is 1-master-script.sh, that will call others properly.
If you don't have a symlink like this:
fpc-bin -> /home/renabor/bin/freepascal/fpc-3.0.4/bin/
the script will fail. Run all the configuration scripts (1-master-script.sh) and you will be ok!
