Summary
Writing games with Bare Game is as easy as it can possibly get

Description
The canonical "Hello World" app in Bare Game looks like this:
<code lang="delphi"><![CDATA[
program hello;

uses
  Bare.Game;

begin
  Application.CreateWindow(TWindow).Caption = 'Hello Gaming World';
  Application.Run;
end.
]]></code>

<code lang="delphi"><![CDATA[
program hello;

uses
  Bare.Game;

begin
  Application.Run(TWindow);
end.
]]></code>
