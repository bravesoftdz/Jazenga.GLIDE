High Priority
- login
- handle zombie views issue. DONE. Debug
- calculate predeliric risk
- consistent code format and naming
Low Priority
- Form mixin: store model as realModel, clone it as this.model and let stickit, validation bind to this.model
- Better router: shared "before" handler to initialize app?
