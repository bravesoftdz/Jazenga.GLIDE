The PlotPanel component

This is a very rude description of the component. See the examples for an
explanation of how to use the component.

This software is presented as is, without any written warrenty. So use the
software at your own risk.

The PlotPanel component is derived from the TCustomPanel-component.

To this Panel are Plotting capabilities added.

The Component has the folowing properties inherited from TPanel:
Align
Anchors
Autosize
BevelInner / Outer / Width
Borderspacing
BorderStyle
Borderwidth

Color is the color of the border of the plot
Constraints
Cursor
Dragmode
Enabled
Font  is the font of the title of the plot
Height
HelpContext
HelpKeyword
HelpType
Hint
Left
Name
ParenColor
Parentfont
ParentShowHint
PopupMenu
ShowHint
TabOrder
TabStop
Tag
Top
Visible
Width

The Component has the following added properties:

BackColor	This is the background color of the plotting area
GridColor	When you make this the same as Backcolor, the grid is invisible
LayerOption	For easy plotting of a single layer this can be set to False.
		Note: it is not possible to set this to True directly (see methods)
Margin		The width of the border of the plot in pixels
PlotMode	Three plotmodes are possible: pmBar, pmLine and pmDot
PlotPen 	properties of the plotting pen. If LayerOption is False, then all
		sub-properties can be set.
		If LayerOption is True, then information about the plotting pen
		is transferred via the LayerOptions method (see later)
Title		The Title is at the top center of the plot and uses the Font property
PlotBMP 	This is a bitmap holding the whole graph (see demo for its use)

The X-axis properties:
XLabel          Label at x-axis
XMarks		When True, the X-axis has marks
XMarksFont	Font used for the XMarks
XMarksInterval	Interval between to lines in the grid (applies for linear scales
only)
XMax		Maximum value of x that is visible
XMin		Minimal value of X that is visible
XScaleLog	When TRUE the scale is logarithmic (the interval is determined
by the program

For the Y-axis the same applies.


Methods:

AddXY(X,Y:Extended)
	With this method you can add points (or lines) to the plot
	Example
	for i:= -10 to 10 do
	   PlotPanel1.AddXY(i,i*i)
	This plots a parbola .The line is plotted with the PlotPen properties
	Note you can only plot a single layer.

AddXY(X,Y:Extended, Color:Tcolor,Layer:Integer);
	With this method it is possible to plot up to 8 lines in different colors,
	plotmodes and penwidths (see LayerOptions how to set linewidth and plotmodes)

LayerOptions(Layer:Integer;PlotMode:TPlotMode;PenWidth:Integer);
	Every Layer can use a different Plotmode and PenWidth
	When you call this method LayerOPtion will be set TRUE. When you want
	to use a single Layer again you have to set LayerOption False!

Autoscale(Layer:Integer);
	With this method you can adjust the size of the plot automaticly

ClearData 
        Clears all data on the plot.
 
ClearData(Layer: Integer) 
        Clears only the data of a single layer on the plot. 

ConvertS2W(x,y: Extended; var WX,WY : Extended);
	Converts the screen-coordinates in X,Y to the real coordinates WX,WY. When
	X and Y are out of bounds, the function returns False, otherwise True

Freeze(Boolean);
	When Freeze(True) is executed all plotting is done on a invisible bitmap.
	After a Freeze(False) the whole plot is displayed. This produces flicker-free
	animations.

HideLayer(Layer:Integer);
	Use this to hide a single layer in the plot


UnHideLayer(Layer:Integer)
	Shows the hidden layer again
	N.B. When you add points to a hidden layer, the old layer is deleted and the
	new points are the only points in this layer!

Paint
	Repaints the whole Graph (is done automaticly by the system when necessairy


Events
OnXMarksWrite and OnYMarksWrite Using these events the user can change the way the 
marks (values) on the axis are written
