Game instructions:

F1 key gives detailed help.
Fire up the TNT with left mouse button.
There is no "game objective" but you
  can investigate many things:
- you can try to piss off that rat by
  firing TNTs near him,
- there is also a "mute area" inside the
  transparent cylinder

Exit with Escape.

And don't ask me why the rat sounds
like a duck.
