This package provides MWA Software's Firebird Pascal API (fbintf). It is intended to provide
a standard set of Language Bindings between programs written for the Free Pascal
Compiler (FPC) and the Firebird Client API. Both the new Firebird 3 and the legacy
API are supported.

fbintf is released under the InterBase Public License for the original code and under the
compatible Initial Developers Public License for new software.

See the "doc" directory for more information, installation instructions and a full 80+ page
guide to the API. fbintf also comes with a comprehensive test suite. See doc/TestSuite.pdf
for more information.

See the "changelog" for information on changes from previous releases
