# LazCodeSigningHelper

LazCodeSigningHelper is an IDE plugin for the [Lararus IDE](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/) that simplifies the task of codesigning output executable on Windows.

It takes any version of signtool.exe and a certificate that can be picked from the store, manually identified by its SHA1 hash, or from .pfx files, a custom timestamping server and various flags and allows to sign the current projects executable using both SHA1 and SHA256.

It is available in source at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ccrdude/lazcodesigninghelper). and can be discussed on the [Lazarus Forums](http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,36861.0.html).
